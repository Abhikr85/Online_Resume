<p>I am from remote village of Bihar with very less facility.<br>
The Journey from that farthest area to Pune has been quite challenging.<br/>
I made new friends, explored new cultures, cuisines and learnt a lot in this process.<br/>
I am commited to be a lifelong learner and I love listening to music, watching movies, reading books in my spare time.
